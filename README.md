# Project Group 10 - "Sell Out"

## Setup and Getting Started
1. Ensure PHP and all other dependencies are installed on your machine. You should also have a git command line tool or desktop application installed.

2. In a terminal or command line, change directory into your PHP projects folder (example on Mac: `cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`)

3. Download or Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/brianbolnick/project-10.git`. This will download the files into the current folder. You can now run `cd project-10` to get into the directory, or just open them through a file browser.
